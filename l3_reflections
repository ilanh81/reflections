When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

forks/branches/clones

- I would use branches when I am working on my own code with a new experimental part (logic, features..) which I would eventually like to merge with the master tree

- I would use fork is I want to clone from a different repository but keep the credits in place

- I would use clone if I want to own a full copy of a different repo and make it as my own
